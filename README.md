> *“Auditory elegance for the modern Linux desktop.”*

## 📖 About
**Fresh and Clean Sound Theme** is a curated collection of minimalist sound cues designed to provide *clear, non-intrusive feedback* for Linux desktop environments. 

This project is a **professional continuation** of the legacy left by **dolphinoracle** (MX Linux Team). While the original repository was a core part of the MX Linux experience, this fork aims to:

* **Modernize** the file structure to meet `freedesktop.org` standards.
* **Expand** the sound palette to include mobile, power, and notification events.
* **Preserve** the "Fresh and Clean" philosophy: sounds that are felt, but not heard as a distraction.
* **Reach** more Linux Distos.
