## 🚀 How Can I Help?

### 📢 Reporting Bugs
If you find a sound that is missing or an event that doesn't trigger correctly:
1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/jemo121/fresh-and-clean-soundtheme/issues) to see if it has already been reported.
2. If not, open a new issue using a clear title and describe your Desktop Environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.).

### 🎼 Suggesting New Sounds
We are always looking to expand our sound palette!
* Suggest sounds for specific apps (Telegram, Discord, Slack).
* Suggest system events that are currently silent.
* **Format:** Please provide a reference (YouTube link or a similar sound) if possible.

### 📦 Packaging & Distros
If you are a maintainer or know how to create packages (`.deb`, `.rpm`, `PKGBUILD`), your help is extremely welcome to reach our goal of being in official repositories.
